Outline is a line drown around the element outside the border.

Outline may overlap the other content round the element we drow this outline around.
>  The border, on the other hand, will actually alter the page's layout to ensure that it fits without overlapping anything else (*unless you explicitly set it to overlap*).

Assignin outline a value of `0` or `none` will remove the browser's defulat focus style

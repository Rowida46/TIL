## Defer in JS

Syntax

```html
<script type="src.js" defer></script>
```

Running any js script in HTML dom page, we need to consider the loading performance of the js application.

Based on where we are adding our script in the HTML page also influences the loading time of the application.


so we need to improve the loading performance by adding `defer` as an attribute within the `<script>` tag

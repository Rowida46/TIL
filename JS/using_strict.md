## `use strict`


Just add `use strict` at the top of your code, before anything else.

In strict mode, constant values are protected from being modified. as in general mode, even constant Val could be modified and they are mutable.

In strict mode we are not allowed to not to use the keyword `var` to declare the variable.



> In strict mode : It similarly disallows a lot of things that are technically valid to do.

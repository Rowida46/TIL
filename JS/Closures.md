## Closures

Closures is a powerfull feature of Javascript that allows for the nesting of functions.

It grants the full access of the outer function variables or functions defined to the inner function as well as all other variables and functions that the outer function has access to.

*To sum up Inner Functions has full access of outer function scope*




>  A *closure* is created when the inner function is somehow made available to any scope outside the outer function.

- Js isan _OOP_ Language however, it's not a class-based object oriented language like c++.

- Server-side JavaScript refers to the use of Node.js. Any JavaScript file loaded via the `<script>` tag in HTML is executed client-side.

- pop :: remove last element, 
shift :: remove first element.

- push :: add to the end,
unshift :: add at the begining.


- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current
scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
• Variables declared with let and const aren’t hoisted.


- JavaScript in strict mode does not allow variables to be used if they are not
declared. Doesn't allow Hoisted.

- Const val can't be redeclaered, and can't be declared without specifing val to it.
- Constants also share a feature with variables declared using let in that they
are block-scoped instead of function-scoped (and thus they are not hoisted)
